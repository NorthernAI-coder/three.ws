# /club audio — provenance and licensing

All seven loops in this directory were synthesised from scratch with
ffmpeg's `lavfi` filtergraph (sine + noise primitives, no third-party
samples). The source recipe lives at
[`/scripts/build-club-audio.mjs`](../../../scripts/build-club-audio.mjs)
and re-running `node scripts/build-club-audio.mjs` regenerates these
files byte-for-byte.

Because no external sample material was used, three.ws holds full
copyright on these audio files and dedicates them to the public domain
under **Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal**

## Mastering notes

Every track is rendered to an integer number of beats so it loops
sample-clean at the seam. `dynaudnorm` (`g=11:p=0.78`) brings peaks
down to roughly −6 dBFS — enough headroom for the post-FX bloom-era
sidechain and for the master gain at 0.75 in
[`src/club-audio.js`](../../../src/club-audio.js) without clipping the
output bus.

Encoder targets:

- **MP3:** mono, 44.1 kHz, 192 kbit/s, libmp3lame.
- **OGG Vorbis:** stereo, 44.1 kHz, qscale 4, libvorbis.

`<audio>` and `decodeAudioData()` consumers fall through to MP3 when
their browser lacks Vorbis (older Safari builds). The mixer in
`src/club-audio.js` requests `.ogg` first and falls back to `.mp3` on
fetch/decode failure — see `loadBuffer()`.

## Regenerating

```sh
node scripts/build-club-audio.mjs
```

Requires `ffmpeg` ≥ 4.4 built with libmp3lame + libvorbis (Ubuntu's
default `apt install ffmpeg` is sufficient). Output is deterministic
within ffmpeg's encoder limits, so committed files only change when
the recipe changes.
