// Schema definitions for the IRL realtime world (irl_world room), shared between
// the IrlRoom (server) and src/irl-net.js (client, bundled by Vite the same way
// it bundles walk's schemas.js).
//
// @colyseus/schema uses delta encoding: only fields that changed since the last
// patch ride the wire, and a late joiner receives the full current set on join.
// This room delta-syncs PRESENCE (the `viewers` map) and broadcasts ambient
// REACTIONS — it does NOT sync pins. Placed agents are private by location and are
// discovered ONLY through the per-viewer /api/irl/pins proximity read (REST), never
// broadcast here as a roster (see IrlRoom.js, which never writes IrlState.pins).
//
// The IrlPin schema + IrlState.pins map below are therefore DORMANT: declared but
// never populated by the server and never read by the client (src/irl-net.js
// consumes viewers + reactions only). They are retained — not deleted — because
// @colyseus/schema's binary protocol is POSITIONAL: removing IrlPin or the `pins`
// field would shift every later field's index and break any client still connected
// to an older deployed server mid-deploy. They cost nothing on the wire while empty.
//
// IMPORTANT: append-only. Field indices are positional in @colyseus/schema's
// binary protocol — inserting in the middle shifts every later index and breaks
// clients still connected to an older deployed server. Always add at the end.
