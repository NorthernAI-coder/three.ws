 * Any helper hardcoded to TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID derives the wrong associated-token
 * address and builds against the wrong program for a Token-2022 mint, so the
 * transfer fails (or a balance lookup misses) for tokens that genuinely exist in
 * the wallet — including $THREE, which is a Token-2022 mint. The mint account's
 * owner is the canonical, on-chain way to tell the two programs apart. The result
 * is memoized for the process, so repeated transfers of the same mint hit RPC once.
 *
 * @throws if the mint account doesn't exist or isn't owned by either SPL program.
