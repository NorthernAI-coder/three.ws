/**
 * Persona presets — @three-ws/page-agent
 * =======================================
 *
 * A preset resolves one `preset="…"` attribute into a full persona: a spoken
 * `greeting`, a `systemRole` (the voice/behavior brief for this persona), a
 * set of `suggestedPrompts` rendered as tappable chips, and a `tools`
 * allowlist. It turns the embed from "configure five props" into "pick a
 * use case" — a one-liner per deployment, mirroring how the owner's SperaxOS
 * widget ships `WIDGET_PRESETS`.
 *
 * ── Reality this composes with ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `page-agent` has no chat backend of its own: it is a client-side TTS
 * narrator (Web Speech API), not an LLM. There is no `fetch()` anywhere in
 * this package and no endpoint it calls (three.ws's LLM chat + tool-calling
 * backend, `api/chat.js`, powers the separate `<agent-3d chat>` component,
 * not this one). So a preset here does two real things and one documented,
 * forward-looking thing:
 *
 *   - `greeting` / `suggestedPrompts` are genuinely functional: the greeting
 *     is spoken via TTS on load, and each suggested prompt is a real chip
 *     that narrates an authored response (or triggers a real method, e.g.
 *     `narratePage()`, when `action: 'tour'`). No network round-trip is
 *     faked — what you hear is static, owner-authored copy the widget
 *     actually speaks, calibrated to never claim dynamic/live knowledge of
 *     the host page it can't have.
 *   - `systemRole` + the sanitized `context` attribute compose into
 *     `buildSystemPrompt()`, a pure string the host page (or a paired
 *     `<agent-3d chat>` on the same page) can read via `guide.systemPrompt`
 *     to brief a *real* LLM. `page-agent` itself never sends it anywhere.
 *   - `tools` is a documented allowlist of capability ids for that future
 *     pairing. It is metadata only today — there is no live backend request
 *     path in this package to enforce it against. Exposed on the element
 *     (`guide.tools` / `currentPreset.tools`) so a host wiring up a real
 *     chat backend has a ready-made scope per persona.
