# One-shot hardening for world.three.ws (Hyperfy on Cloud Run).
#
# Why: without ADMIN_CODE, Hyperfy grants EVERY visitor admin rights — anyone
# can delete the ground, replace the scene, or fill the world with broken GLBs.
# This is what broke the world on 2026-06-12 (scene script asset lost, every
# player fell into the void on join).
#
# Run from the repo root with an account that has Cloud Run, Secret Manager,
# and Cloud Build access on project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5:
#   bash deploy/world/apply-hardening.sh
#
# It prints the generated admin code once. Store it in a password manager —
# in-world, builders claim rights with the chat command: /admin <code>
