# Launch Studio — coin-launch use cases

The **Launch Studio** ([three.ws/launch-studio](https://three.ws/launch-studio))
is a catalog of 50 ready-made coin-launch recipes. Each recipe pulls a live
signal, turns it into a concrete coin identity, and routes the coin's creator
fees — then previews exactly what it would mint **right now** before you launch
on pump.fun in one click.

It's built on the shared [launch use-case engine](../api/_lib/launch/README.md).

## Two kinds of recipe

| Mode | What it mints | Where fees go |
|---|---|---|
| **Reward** (`attribution`) | A coin *for* a real subject — a trending GitHub repo or creator. | The subject's GitHub account, via the fee-sharing / social-fee system. This is the `$THREE → @nirholas` pattern, automated. |
| **Theme** (`narrative`) | An original coin riding a live cultural, news, or onchain narrative. | The launching agent (creator fees) — delegate later from the [fees panel](../public/studio/fees-panel.js). |

## The catalog (50 recipes, 6 categories)

- **GitHub (12)** — trending repos and creators, by language (Rust, TypeScript,
  Python, Go, Solidity, AI/ML notebooks), fresh weekly breakouts, surging
  established projects, and top builders. Fees route to the repo owner / creator.
- **Onchain (8)** — pump.fun venue signals: breakout categories, oracle
  conviction sectors, blended momentum, AI-agent and degen metas.
- **News (8)** — Hacker News tech zeitgeist, Google search surges, Wikipedia top
  events, and crossover blends.
- **Culture (10)** — fresh confirmed memes, Reddit hot, X chatter, and broad
  meme mixes.
- **Events (6)** — what the world is looking up: Wikipedia top-of-day, live search
  spikes, sports/entertainment moments.
- **Community (6)** — ecosystem contributors and builders (reward coins) plus
  cross-source culture blends.

## How a preview works

1. Open `/launch-studio`. Search across all 50 recipes, filter by category
   (colour-themed tabs) or type (Reward / Theme), star favourites, or hit
   **Surprise me** for a random one. `/` focuses search; `Esc` closes.
2. Click a recipe to open the **live preview drawer** — the coins it would mint
   right now from live data, each with an avatar, name, ticker, description, a
   signal-strength bar, and its reward routing.
3. Hit **Launch this coin** to open the existing [`/launch`](https://three.ws/launch)
   wizard with the identity prefilled, then mint on-chain from your wallet or an
   agent's custodial wallet.

## Reward routing — to anyone, not just GitHub

The preview drawer has a **reward planner**: route a coin's creator fees to any of

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| **As designed** | The recipe's built-in routing (e.g. the repo owner). |
| **Creator** | Fees stay with the launching wallet. |
| **GitHub @user** | 100% to a GitHub account (pump.fun social platform 2). |
| **X @handle** | 100% to an X / Twitter account (pump.fun social platform 1). |
| **Wallet / .sol** | 100% to a fixed Solana address or name. |
| **Cashback** | Trading fees return to holders. |
| **Buyback** | Fees auto-buy-back & burn the coin. |

The same generalisation powers the post-launch [fees panel](../public/studio/fees-panel.js):
its recipient box accepts a **GitHub @user**, an **X handle** (`x:@handle`), a
raw **Solana wallet**, or an **owner/repo** to split across contributors. All of
it resolves through one shared resolver ([`api/_lib/github-reward.js`](../api/_lib/github-reward.js),
`resolveSocialReward`) so GitHub and X route identically.

For reward coins, after the coin graduates you set the GitHub recipient in the
[fees panel](../public/studio/fees-panel.js) (type a `@username` → 100%, or
import a repo's contributors to split) — see the fee-sharing flow.

## API

Public, rate-limited, read-only. Reward routing in `preview` is **intent-only** —
it never reveals whether a GitHub user has a linked wallet; the concrete address
resolves on the authed launch path.
