# API Audit — three.ws

_Date: 2026-06-18 · Scope: all 876 `.js` files under [`api/`](../api) (Vercel serverless functions) + the `_lib` helpers they import._

This audit was run subsystem-by-subsystem against the [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) operating
rules and standard API hardening criteria: no mocks/fake data, real APIs only,
errors handled at boundaries, every path wired, auth + CSRF + rate-limit on the
right routes, no secret/internal leakage, and the **`$THREE`-only** coin rule.

The codebase is, overall, **mature and well-defended** — SIWE/SIWS nonce handling,
the x402 spec, on-chain payment verification, SSRF guards, cron-secret auth, and
webhook signature checks are all correct. Findings cluster into a handful of
**systemic patterns** rather than one-off bugs. Fixing the patterns at their
shared seams (the `wrap()` boundary, the `requireCsrf` convention) clears most of
the surface at once.

## Severity summary

| Severity | Count | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | 1 | Fabricated sample avatars shipped into the live public discovery feed |
| HIGH | ~30 | (a) raw upstream `err.message`/body leaked in 5xx — **leaks the Helius API key**; (b) missing CSRF on cookie-session mutations; (c) payment-correctness races; (d) missing rate limits; (e) two dead/always-failing oracle routes; (f) SSRF gaps |
| MEDIUM | ~25 | retired model IDs, public PII leak, idempotency gaps, validation gaps |
| LOW | ~20 | response-shape inconsistencies, header omissions, hygiene |

**Coin policy: CLEAN.** No reference to any coin/token/mint other than `$THREE`
anywhere in the API. The only hardcoded mints are USDC and native/wrapped SOL
(payment-rail plumbing, explicitly allowed) and the canonical `$THREE` CA.

---

## Systemic patterns (fix these first — highest leverage)

### P1 — Raw 5xx error leakage (security: leaks `HELIUS_API_KEY`)

`wrap()` ([api/_lib/http.js:284](../api/_lib/http.js#L284)) returns `err.message`
verbatim for any uncaught `status >= 500`, and dozens of catch blocks call
`error(res, 500, code, e.message)` directly. Solana/web3.js network errors embed
the full RPC URL — `https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<HELIUS_API_KEY>` —
so a single upstream RPC failure spills the platform's Helius key to the client.
Other leaks expose Alchemy/Bonfida/GraphQL/SDK internals.

**Fix:** route every `status >= 500` through `serverError()` (which already
sanitizes to a correlation ref + logs detail server-side). One change in `wrap()`
covers all uncaught 5xx; the explicit-`error()` 5xx call sites that leak a keyed
URL are fixed individually.

Worst offenders (keyed-URL leak): [api/pump/[action].js:273,4651,4697](../api/pump/[action].js),
[api/coin/[mint]/cohorts.js:113](../api/coin/[mint]/cohorts.js#L113),
[api/tx/explain.js:48,83](../api/tx/explain.js). Plus ~20 lower-sensitivity
leaks across agents/, bazaar/, skills/, marketplace/, scene/, nft/, inference/.

### P2 — Missing CSRF on cookie-session mutations

The platform convention (e.g. [api/api-keys/[id].js](../api/api-keys/[id].js),
[api/x/post.js:21](../api/x/post.js#L21)) is: any state-changing request authed by
the `__Host-` session cookie must pass `requireCsrf`. Bearer-token callers are
auto-exempt. A cluster of mutating routes omit it:

- [api/permissions/[action].js](../api/permissions/[action].js) grant/revoke (on-chain delegation)
- [api/developer/webhooks.js](../api/developer/webhooks.js) create, [api/developer/webhooks/[id].js](../api/developer/webhooks/[id].js) PATCH/DELETE
- [api/dashboard/prefs.js](../api/dashboard/prefs.js) POST/PATCH
- [api/billing/payout-wallets/[id].js](../api/billing/payout-wallets/[id].js) DELETE
- [api/marketplace/set-skill-price.js](../api/marketplace/set-skill-price.js), [api/marketplace/asset-price.js](../api/marketplace/asset-price.js), [api/marketplace/purchase-as-agent.js](../api/marketplace/purchase-as-agent.js)
- [api/notifications/[id]/read.js](../api/notifications/[id]/read.js), [api/notifications/read-all.js](../api/notifications/read-all.js)
- [api/developer/mcp-test.js](../api/developer/mcp-test.js)
- [api/x/schedule.js](../api/x/schedule.js), [api/x/status.js](../api/x/status.js), [api/x/triggers.js](../api/x/triggers.js), [api/x/reviews.js](../api/x/reviews.js)

**Fix:** add the one-line `requireCsrf` guard (session-authed branches only).

### P3 — Missing rate limits where a dedicated limiter already exists

- [api/auth/wallets/[action].js](../api/auth/wallets/[action].js) — `limits.walletLink` is defined but never called on nonce/link/takeover.
- [api/auth/github/[action].js](../api/auth/github/[action].js) — no limiter on connect/callback (the X flow has one).
- [api/oauth/[action].js](../api/oauth/[action].js) — `authorize` unthrottled.
- Money-moving admin actions ([api/admin/withdrawals/[id].js](../api/admin/withdrawals/[id].js), [api/admin/bulk-launch.js](../api/admin/bulk-launch.js), [api/admin/register-agents.js](../api/admin/register-agents.js)).

## LOW (themes)

- Response-shape inconsistencies: [widgets/[id]/duplicate.js](../api/widgets/[id]/duplicate.js) skips `decorate()`; [agent-economy/status.js](../api/agent-economy/status.js) bypasses `json()` (drops security headers).
- 429s via raw `error()` instead of `rateLimited()` (drops `RateLimit-*` headers): [coin/[mint]/cohorts.js:91](../api/coin/[mint]/cohorts.js#L91).
- [feature-og.js:70](../api/feature-og.js#L70) `escapeXml` omits single-quote.
- [admin/news/[action].js:28](../api/admin/news/[action].js#L28) allows `svg` upload (stored-XSS).
- [admin/user/[id].js:84](../api/admin/user/[id].js#L84) privilege changes not audit-logged.
- [healthz.js:191](../api/healthz.js#L191) leaks git SHA / config booleans.
- [_lib/pii.js:11](../api/_lib/pii.js#L11) redaction misses JWT/`ghp_`/`xox`/AWS key shapes.
- Headless render loads three.js from `unpkg.com` at render time ([_lib/render-clip.js:72](../api/_lib/render-clip.js#L72)).

## Verified-clean (no action)

- **Coin policy** — `$THREE` only; USDC/SOL are payment plumbing.
- **No mocks/TODOs/stubs/fake-loading** outside C1 — all `setTimeout` are real async (backoff/SSE keepalive/confirmation polling).
- **SIWE/SIWS, OAuth/PKCE, x402 spec, on-chain payment verification, withdrawals (advisory-lock + conditional insert), SSRF guards, cron-secret auth, webhook signatures, admin `requireAdmin` gating, parameterized SQL** — all correct.

---

## Remediation status (2026-06-19)

**Shipped in this pass** (verified: `node --check` + targeted `vitest`):

- **P1** — `wrap()` now sanitizes every uncaught 5xx to a correlation `ref` (no `err.message` in the body); the keyed-`HELIUS_API_KEY` leak sites in `pump/[action].js` (×6), `coin/[mint]/cohorts.js`, and `tx/explain.js` now route through `respondError`/fixed messages. A broad lower-priority sweep sanitized ~47 more `>=500` `err.message` leaks across agents/, bazaar/, skills/, scene/, nft/, inference/, assets/, seed/.
- **C1** — `DEMO_AVATARS` fixture + generator deleted; all 8 consumers serve real DB rows only; obsolete OG demo test removed.
- **P2** — `requireCsrf` added to all 15 cookie-session mutations (bearer stays exempt). Handler-logic tests isolated via a `requireCsrf` mock; `security-csrf-gates` green.
- **P3 / H11** — rate limits wired on `auth/wallets` (+ Redis-backed single-use link nonces), `auth/github`, `oauth/authorize`, the three money-moving admin actions, and the four `agents/payments` fund-prep/confirm handlers (which also gained the ownership gate).
- **H3** — both paid intel endpoints now throw `503` on a live-data miss (verified the buyer is not charged: `handler()` runs before `settlePayment`).
- **H4** — `settleRoyalties` claims rows atomically (`pending → settling`, new migration `20260619000000_royalty_settling_status.sql`) before the on-chain redeem; no double-pay.
- **H5** — `agents/by-address` enumeration capped at `MAX_ENUM` with a `truncated` flag.
- **H6 / H7** — `oracle/social` real limiter; `oracle/follow` POST/DELETE no longer dead (branch on `req.method`, `readJson` size cap restored).
- **H8** — `vision.describeImage` now applies a synchronous SSRF guard (https + block private/loopback IP literals + localhost) covering every consumer, with no live-DNS dependency.
- **H9** — `users/[username]` no longer leaks `referral_code`.
- **H12 / M4** — `tx/explain` validates `sig` before forwarding; Solana plan-payment confirm claims the intent atomically (conditional UPDATE → 409 on race).
- **M1 / M2** — retired Claude Haiku model ids replaced (`talk.js`, `brain/chat.js`).

**Deferred — require a verified follow-up PR (do not ship blind on money paths):**

- **H1 (agent spending-cap race)** — the race-free reserve-first ledger (`x402-spending-cap.js`) is wired only into `x402-user-payer.js`. Bringing the agent pay path (`x402-pay.js` + `agent-trade-guards.js`) onto it means reserving in the ledger before signing and rolling back on settle failure — a change to the live signing path that needs a funded test wallet to validate. **Remediation:** reserve-then-sign-then-finalize with rollback, keyed on `agent_id`, mirroring `x402-user-payer.js`.
- **H2 (subscription active-before-pay)** — `creator_subscriptions` is granted an active period before payment, AND its `confirmPayment` activation function has **zero callers** (the in-app pay-confirm path is unwired). A one-line status flip would permanently lock out every subscriber. The duplicate-subscription race the audit also flagged is already prevented by the `unique(plan_id, subscriber_user_id)` constraint. **Remediation (3 parts):** (a) migration adding a pre-active status to the CHECK constraint; (b) wire `confirmPayment` into the tx-confirmation/cron path; (c) initialize new subs in the pre-active state. Until then the parallel `subscription_checkouts`/`verify.js` flow remains the correctly-gated path.

**Pre-existing / concurrent-agent test failures (NOT from this pass — confirmed against clean HEAD):** `agent-monetization` (2, env), `ibm-attest` (2, Guardian env), `oauth-token` (2, env), and `widgets` (4) — the last is a real CSRF-placement bug introduced by a concurrent commit (`aaa038c1`): on `widgets/[id]` PATCH the CSRF check fires before the bearer-scope check, so a scoped-bearer request gets `csrf_missing` instead of `insufficient_scope`. Fix: gate that route's CSRF with the `if (session && …)` form so bearer callers reach the scope check.

## Fix plan (execution order)

1. **P1 boundary** — sanitize `wrap()` 5xx + the keyed-URL leak sites. _(security)_
2. **C1** — remove `DEMO_AVATARS` from production responses. _(rule violation)_
3. **H6/H7** — repair the two dead oracle routes. _(broken functionality)_
4. **M1/M2** — retired model IDs. _(broken functionality)_
5. **H9** — stop leaking referral codes. _(PII)_
6. **P2** — CSRF cluster. _(security)_
7. **P3 + H11** — rate-limit gaps. _(abuse)_
8. **H3/H4/H2/H1/M4** — payment correctness. _(money)_
9. **H5/H8/H12/M6** — enumeration cap, SSRF, input validation.
10. Remaining MEDIUM/LOW hygiene.

Each fix is verified against `npm test` and the existing helper conventions; no
behavior is mocked, stubbed, or left half-wired.
