# Store Submission Prompts — three.ws MCP

Goal: get three.ws listed in **(1) the Claude Connectors Directory** and **(2) the OpenAI ChatGPT App Directory**.

Each file in this folder is a **self-contained prompt** you paste into a fresh Claude Code chat in this repo. Run them in the order below. Each prompt drives one work-stream to a verified, production-complete state and ends by telling you exactly what to hand to the next chat.

## Strategic summary (read once)

The two stores are very different problems:

- **Claude Connectors Directory — achievable now.** The server already has remote streamable-HTTP transport, OAuth 2.1, per-tool `title` + annotations, manifests, a privacy policy, and a published npm package. The work is *verify + package + write the reviewer guide*. The directory explicitly permits transactional connectors, so the x402 paid model is allowed — the reviewer just needs a free end-to-end path (`forge_free`) and clean `PaymentRequired` responses.

- **OpenAI ChatGPT App Directory — needs repackaging.** OpenAI's submission policy prohibits "tokens or credits," "embedded third-party payment solutions," and "crypto speculation schemes." The current x402-per-call model and the token/pump.fun tools are disqualifying as-is. The viable route is a **separate, free, non-crypto 3D-avatar app** exposing only the generation tools (`forge_free`, `text_to_avatar`, `mesh_forge`, `rig_mesh`, `forge_avatar`) with an embedded GLB-viewer component — no x402, no token tooling.

## Run order

### Track A — Claude Connectors Directory (do first)
1. `01-claude-tool-annotation-audit.md` — every tool has a correct `title` + annotation set. (Also unblocks OpenAI.)
2. `02-claude-reviewer-access-guide.md` — free verification path, graceful `PaymentRequired`, reviewer setup/test-account doc.
3. `03-claude-submission-package.md` — privacy URL, allowed-links, server metadata, the exact form-fill content + compliance acknowledgments.

### Track B — OpenAI ChatGPT App (do after Track A, or in parallel)
4. `04-openai-free-3d-endpoint.md` — a free, non-crypto, scoped 3D-generation MCP endpoint.
5. `05-openai-apps-sdk-component.md` — the embedded GLB-viewer UI component the Apps SDK expects.
6. `06-openai-submission-package.md` — OpenAI directory metadata, policy-compliance audit, screenshots, developer verification.

### Track C — Differentiation layer (the 10x–100x; what makes us NOT just another listing)
Baseline (01–06) gets us *listed*. Track C makes us *un-ignorable*. The thesis: three.ws is the only platform in either store with generation + agent payments + agent coordination in one place — so we ship the new primitive nobody else can: **embodied, economically-autonomous agents, and 3D as a native conversational medium.**
7. `07-embodied-agent-live-avatar.md` — a persistent 3D body that lip-syncs, emotes, and idles inline. The consumer screenshot moment. (Both stores.)
8. `08-live-agent-commerce.md` — autonomous discover→reputation→pay→delegate, made *visible* with provenance receipts. The agent-economy demo. (Claude/paid only.)
9. `09-conversational-remixable-3d.md` — iterate on a model by talking to it ("bigger helmet"), plus remixable assets with provenance + automatic creator royalties. (Iteration: both stores. Royalties: Claude/paid only.)

The 100x meta-move (positioning, not a single prompt): don't just *be in* the stores — **own a category across them.** Publish an open pattern for 3D-native / spatial MCP responses (tool results that return live interactive scenes, not text) and x402 agent-commerce patterns, and be the reference implementation other apps call under the hood. Infrastructure, not an app.

**Sequencing:** ship 01–06 first (real listings beat vision). Then 07 is the highest-leverage single add — it's the headline screenshot for both listings. 08 and 09 deepen the moat.

## Rules every chat must follow (from CLAUDE.md)

- **No mocks, no fake data, no placeholders, no TODOs.** Real APIs, real endpoints, finish what you start.
- **$THREE is the only coin.** Never reference any other token anywhere. The OpenAI track must contain **zero** token/crypto surface.
- **Stage explicit paths only** (never `git add -A`/`.`) — concurrent agents share this worktree. Re-check `git status` before any commit.
- **Commit/push only when the human running the chat explicitly asks.** When they do: push to **both** remotes (`git push threeD main` and `git push threews main`).
- **Changelog:** user-visible changes get an entry in `data/changelog.json`; run `npm run build:pages` to validate.
- **Watch the `npx vercel build` trap** — it overwrites `api/*.js` with esbuild bundles. Check `head -1` of changed `api/` files for `__defProp` before committing.

## Repo orientation
- Remote MCP endpoints: `api/_mcp/` (main), `api/_mcp3d/` (3D Studio), `api/_mcpagent/` (agent), `api/_mcpbazaar/`, `api/_mcpibm/`.
- Per-tool defs (with `title` + `annotations`): the `tools/*.js` files under each `api/_mcp*/` dir.
- Published stdio server: `mcp-server/` (`@three-ws/mcp-server`), tools in `mcp-server/src/tools/`.
- Manifests: `server.json`, `server-3d.json`, `server-agent.json`, `server-bazaar.json`, `server-ibm.json`, `server-pumpfun.json`, `mcp-server/server.json`.
- Legal: `public/legal/privacy.html`, `tos.html`, `content-policy.html`.
- Deploy: `vercel.json`. OAuth: `api/_mcp/auth.js` + `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`.
