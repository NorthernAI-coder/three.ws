# OKX.AI Launch — Progress Log

Handoff file for the work-order sequence in this directory. Each session appends a dated
entry: what was done, what was verified, what's blocked, what's next. (Created by the
Work Order 04 session — no earlier entries existed because no earlier work order has run.)

## 2026-07-06 — Work Order 04 session: NO-GO, preconditions not met

**Outcome: Work Order 04 (e2e real payment test) cannot run. Work Orders 01, 02, and 03
have not been executed.** No code was changed and no money was spent this session.

### Precondition audit (all checks failed)

1. **`specs/okx-agent-payments.md` does not exist** (WO 01 deliverable). `specs/` contains
   no OKX-related file.
2. **No X Layer / OKX rail in the payment code** (WO 02 deliverable). A repo-wide grep of
   `api/` for `eip155:196`, `xlayer`, the marketplace fee token `0x779ded0c…3736`, and
   `facilitatorAddress` returns zero hits. `paymentRequirements()` in
   `api/_lib/x402-spec.js` is unchanged from the state described in 00-CONTEXT.
3. **Production confirms it.** Live probe of `https://three.ws/api/mcp-3d` (unpaid
   `tools/call`) returned HTTP 401 with an x402 v2 `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` challenge whose
   `accepts` array offers ONLY Solana mainnet (USDC + $THREE). No `eip155:196` entry, no
   OKX facilitator, no fee-token asset. This is byte-for-byte the rejection cause from
   2026-07-04. Evidence: `e2e-evidence/00-precondition-probe-headers.txt` and
   `e2e-evidence/00-precondition-probe-402-body.json`.
4. **No micro-priced service decomposition** (WO 03 deliverable). The gauntlet's target
   services ($0.01 Text→3D, $0.50 Text→Rigged Avatar on the OKX rail) do not exist; the
   live challenge prices are the pre-existing Solana ones.
5. **Misleading commit in history:** `839c9a654` is titled "feat: Implement OKX Agent
   Payments Protocol integration and service decomposition" but its diff contains ONLY the
   `prompts/okx-ai/*` and `prompts/gcp-credits/*` work-order documents — zero
   implementation. Do not trust that title when auditing state.

### What WAS verified (useful for the next sessions)

- Session preflight passes: `onchainos` v4.2.0, wallet logged in as `claude@three.ws`
  (account `31889ded-f1dc-47b0-8fc3-dc4f813984fd`).
- **Buyer TEE wallet EVM address is `0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69` on every
  EVM chain — identical to our seller `payTo` / owner wallet from 00-CONTEXT.** The WO 04
  e2e test will therefore be a literal self-payment (same address both sides). Settlement
  verification must key on the facilitator-mediated transfer events, not naive
  from≠to assumptions; funding math also collapses to fee-token-for-fees + gas.
- Production endpoint is up, emits well-formed x402 v2 challenges, and advertises Bazaar
  discovery metadata — the existing Solana rail is healthy (good sign for WO 04 case 7,
  legacy-rail regression).

### Blocked on / next

- **Dispatch Work Order 01 (`01-protocol-research.md`) next**, then 02, then 03, in order.
  Only then re-run 04.
- No funding request was presented to the owner: the amounts in WO 04 Phase 1 depend on
  WO 03's price points, which don't exist yet. Requesting funds now would be premature.
- **GO/NO-GO for Work Order 05: NO-GO** (transitively — 04 never ran).
