# snapshot-export-day.sh — recover a full daily snapshot set from git history.
#
# The daily snapshots live at stable paths (snapshots/current/) that are
# overwritten each run, so the working tree only ever holds the latest day.
# Every prior day is preserved in git history via that day's commit. This
# script checks out the snapshot set as it existed on (or just before) a given
# date and copies it to snapshots/exported/<date>/ so you can browse it.
#
#   Usage: scripts/snapshot-export-day.sh 2026-06-05
