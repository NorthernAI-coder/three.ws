// Retry + bounded-timeout guard for standalone, idempotent DB writes.
//
// Neon's HTTP driver does a `fetch` per query. On Vercel, cold connections and
// momentary network blips surface as `NeonDbError: Error connecting to database:
// fetch failed` — a connection-level failure where the request never reached
// Postgres, so no statement ran. These are transient and safe to retry (the
// query is never half-applied: a failed connect can't have committed a write).
// SQL errors (constraint violations, syntax, 22021 NUL, etc.) are deterministic
// and surface unchanged.
//
// A second failure mode is worse than a clean error: a Neon connection that
// neither errors nor returns. The HTTP `fetch` can stall (DNS, TLS, a wedged
// compute waking from scale-to-zero), and a serverless function that awaits it
// burns its whole wall-clock budget and is killed by the platform with no error
// the caller can react to. So every attempt here runs under a bounded deadline:
// if the query outlives `timeoutMs` (total across attempts) we reject with a
// `DbTimeoutError` instead of hanging. A timeout is classified transient — but
// because the deadline is the *total* budget, a timed-out attempt has by
// definition consumed the remaining budget, so the loop exits and surfaces the
// timeout rather than retrying a query that is merely slow.
//
// This lives apart from db.js on purpose: the bare `sql` tagged template must
// keep returning Neon's lazy query object so callers can still batch them with
// `sql.transaction([...])`, and most tests mock `db.js` directly — keeping the
// retry wrapper here means it loads its real implementation regardless. Use it
// around standalone, idempotent statements where a transient blip otherwise
// drops data — e.g. the fire-and-forget audit/usage writes.
