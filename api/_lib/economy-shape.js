// Pure shaping for the owner-facing agent economy summary (api/agents/:id/economy).
//
// Money is earned three real, distinct ways on three.ws and each is its own
// ledger: skill sales (agent_revenue_events), hires from other agents over the
// x402 mesh (agent_hires), and tips (agent_custody_events). This module composes
// those buckets into the summary's `earnings` object and the running total.
//
// It is deliberately I/O-free — every input is already a plain number from a
// ledger query — so the invariants that matter (hires are their own bucket; the
// total sums all three without double-counting) are unit-testable in full.
