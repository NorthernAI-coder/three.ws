/**
 * Builds the `policyData` bytes `GreenfieldVault.buy(objectId, policyData)`
 * (prompt 10, `contracts/src/GreenfieldVault.sol`) forwards untouched to the
 * real `PermissionHub.createPolicy` cross-chain syn-package (prompt 10's own
 * comment: "GNFD protobuf-encoded principal/resource/statements, built
 * off-chain by the unlock API using bnb-chain's greenfield-js-sdk permission
 * codec against this object's real GRN and msg.sender as principal") — the
 * one piece of that design prompts 09/10/11 all deferred building. Prompt 12
 * (vault UI) is the first caller that actually needs real bytes to submit
 * with `buy()`, so it lands here.
 *
 * Wire-format provenance (verified live 2026-07-08 against
 * `bnb-chain/greenfield-contracts` `master`): `AdditionalPermissionHub.
 * _prepareCreatePolicy` embeds the caller-supplied `_data` verbatim as
 * `createPolicySynPackage.data` — the syn-package's OTHER fields (operator,
 * extraData) are populated by the hub itself, never by the caller. So `_data`
 * IS the real Greenfield-side permission payload; the on-chain effect of a
 * settled create is exactly a `greenfield.permission.Policy` object (see
 * `Policy.id`'s doc-comment: "unique u256 sequence... also used as NFT
 * tokenID" — the exact value `GreenfieldVault.sales[saleId].policyId` records
 * on `PolicyGranted`). This module encodes that same `Policy` shape (every
 * field except `id`, which Greenfield assigns on settlement) using the REAL
 * generated protobuf encoder from `@bnb-chain/greenfield-cosmos-types`
 * (`Policy.encode`/`.finish()` — CLAUDE.md: never hand-roll a wire format;
 * this is the identical codegen `@bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk`'s own
 * `putObjectPolicy` builds its `MsgPutPolicy.resource`/`statements` from).
 *
 * Honest caveat this module does NOT paper over: the exact byte-for-byte
 * acceptance of this encoding by the live PermissionHub's GNFD-side keeper
 * has not been independently confirmed against a real relayed transaction in
 * this session — that confirmation needs a real deployed `GreenfieldVault`
 * AND a real Greenfield-mirrored object (both blocked on the same funded-key
 * wall as 07/09/10/11/13/14/18). `resourceId` below is never fabricated: it
 * is read live from `getObjectMeta` (the object's real on-chain Greenfield
 * id), so this function can ONLY ever succeed for an object that has
 * genuinely completed real Greenfield upload+mirroring — which, as of this
 * writing, no vault listing in this campaign has (prompt 11's own proof
 * documents the same gap). Until then this returns a typed, honest error
 * rather than inventing a resourceId. Closing this wire-format confirmation
 * is prompt 13's (vault-e2e-proof) job once funding lands.
