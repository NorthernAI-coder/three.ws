// Cosmetic ownership ledger (R22) — the durable record of which premium
// cosmetics an account has purchased over the x402 USDC rail.
//
// It lives in the SAME persistence the rest of the /play economy uses — Upstash
// Redis (REST), the store playerStore.js and presence-store.js already speak —
// so there's no new provider to operate. Ownership is keyed by the player's
// stable ACCOUNT id (their Solana wallet once authenticated, otherwise the guest
// id the client persists), NOT by the paying wallet: a buyer can settle the USDC
// on Base or Solana, and the cosmetic still lands on the account they bought it
// for. Each account is one Redis SET, `cosmetics:owned:<account>`, holding the
// catalog ids it owns — so a grant is naturally idempotent (owning a cosmetic
// twice is owning it once) and a read is a single SMEMBERS.
//
// Ownership is written ONLY here, by the verified-payment handler in
// api/x402/cosmetic-purchase.js. The shop (R21) and the owned-inventory (R23)
// read it. Reads degrade gracefully to "owns nothing" if Redis is unreachable —
// the shop still renders, items just show as lockable. Grants FAIL CLOSED: if we
// can't persist the unlock we throw, so the x402 flow never settles a charge it
// can't record (matching the fail-closed invariants in x402-security-hardening).
