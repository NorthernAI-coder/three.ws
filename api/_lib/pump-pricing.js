// Per-tool pricing for paid MCP tools, settled via pump-agent-payments.
//
// Today: a static map keyed by tool name → { amount_usdc, currency_mint?, recipient_mint? }.
//   - `amount_usdc` is the price per call (for one-shots) or per window (for subs).
//   - `recipient_mint` defaults to env.PUMP_DEFAULT_AGENT_MINT — the platform agent.
//   - Tools omitted from this map are free.
//
// Subscription bypass: if a payer has a confirmed `pump_agent_payments` row
// for the resolved mint whose end_time is in the future and tool_name matches
// (or is null = unrestricted access), the call is permitted without a fresh
// payment.
//
// We expose this map via the existing tools/list response so MCP clients see
// the price next to each tool.
