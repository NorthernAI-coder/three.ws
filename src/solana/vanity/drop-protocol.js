/**
 * Sealed wallet drops — the protocol primitive.
 *
 * A "drop" is a pre-funded Solana wallet handed to a recipient as an
 * end-to-end-encrypted gift. The wallet's secret key/seed is sealed (ECIES,
 * sealed-envelope.js) so neither the operator, the database, a log, nor anyone
 * but the holder of the matching X25519 private key can open it. This module is
 * the trust-free core shared by the server endpoint, the SDK, and the tests:
 * it derives deterministic drop ids and claim tokens, and pins their behaviour
 * with vectors — never re-implementing the sealed envelope or the cipher.
 *
 * ── Two seal modes (both real, both operator-blind) ──────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. DIRECT SEAL. The sender already knows the recipient's X25519 public key.
 *    The wallet secret is sealed to it at creation; only that recipient's
 *    private key opens it. The link/QR merely points at the (already sealed)
 *    envelope. A leaked link reveals nothing without the recipient's key.
 *
 * 2. CLAIM-TIME SEAL (bearer drop). The sender does not know the recipient. At
 *    creation the server generates a throwaway X25519 "claim keypair", seals
 *    the wallet secret to its PUBLIC key, stores only the sealed envelope +ip
 *    the claim PUBLIC key, and returns the claim SECRET key to the sender ONCE.
 *    That claim secret travels in the URL fragment (`#k=…`) — which browsers
 *    never send to a server — so the link is the bearer token. To claim, the
 *    holder proves possession of the claim secret with a one-time claim TOKEN
 *    (`claimToken = SHA-256("three-drop/claim-token/v1" ‖ dropId ‖ claimSecret)`)
 *    that the server compares against the stored `claimTokenHash`
 *    (`SHA-256("three-drop/claim-token-hash/v1" ‖ claimToken)`). The server can
 *    verify the token without ever learning the claim secret, gates the
 *    exactly-once claim on it, and then releases the sealed envelope — which the
 *    holder opens client-side with the claim secret from the fragment.
 *
 * ── Honest threat model (documented, not hand-waved) ─────────────────────────
 *
 *   • A leaked DATABASE / compromised operator → cannot open any drop. The
 *     server only ever holds the sealed envelope + the claim-token HASH; the
 *     plaintext secret and the claim secret never touch the server.
 *   • A leaked LINK (claim-time-seal mode) → IS bearer access, exactly like a
 *     paper gift card: whoever holds the fragment can claim. This is inherent to
 *     a shareable bearer gift and is stated plainly in the UI. Mitigations:
 *     short expiry, exactly-once claim (a thief and the recipient cannot both
 *     win), and direct-seal mode when the recipient's key is known up front.
 *   • A leaked LINK (direct-seal mode) → reveals nothing: the envelope is sealed
 *     to the recipient's key, which is never in the link.
 *   • Replay / double-claim → impossible: the claim is an atomic compare-and-set
 *     in the store (open→claimed), idempotent on the claim token.
