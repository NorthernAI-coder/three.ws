// Pure room-relative anchoring math for /irl world-locked agents.
//
// Why this exists
// ───────────────
// Today every placed agent is anchored to its OWN absolute GPS coordinate. That
// is fine at city scale ("an agent somewhere in this plaza") but it breaks at
// ROOM scale: consumer GPS is accurate to ~5–15 m, so two agents you place 3 m
// apart — one on the couch to your right, one on the wall to your left — fall
// well inside the same GPS noise. Independent per-agent GPS lets their relative
// positions smear and even swap sides, and it differs phone-to-phone, so a
// second viewer never sees the same layout.
//
// The fix is a shared ROOM FRAME. A room has ONE origin (a GPS coordinate + a
// reference bearing). Every agent in the room is stored as an EXACT offset from
// that origin in metres (relEast / relNorth) plus the bearing it faces. The
// consequences:
//
//   • Intra-room geometry is exact and identical for everyone. Couch-agent at
//     (+2 E, +1 N) and wall-agent at (−2 E, +1 N) are always 4 m apart on
//     opposite sides — GPS noise translates the WHOLE cluster together, it can
//     never smear agents relative to each other.
//   • You calibrate the ROOM ONCE, not each agent. Nudging the origin moves the
//     entire cluster, so a single "drag the room onto its real spot" gesture
//     aligns every agent at once.
//   • GPS is demoted to an INDEX: it only decides which room you load and places
//     the cluster roughly in the world. Compass north is the shared reference
//     that lets two phones agree on the frame without a visual scan.
//
// This module is the pure geometry that makes that work. No DOM, no Three.js, no
// I/O — it returns plain numbers/objects so the client constructs Vector3s and
// the test suite verifies the math directly (mirrors multiplayer/src/
// irl-reactions.js as a pure, unit-tested policy core).
//
// Coordinate conventions — IDENTICAL to src/irl.js, do not drift:
//   World:   North = −Z · East = +X · Y = up · 1 unit = 1 metre.
//   Compass: bearing 0–359° clockwise from true north (0 = N, 90 = E).
//   World yaw from a compass bearing: yaw = −(deg · π/180)  (matches pinYawRad).
//   Local→world: east → +X, north → −Z.

// Metres per degree. Latitude is effectively constant; longitude shrinks with
// the cosine of latitude. We project longitude around the ORIGIN's latitude so a
// room is internally consistent (the few-metre error a degree of cos() drift
// would add only appears thousands of km away, never within one room).
